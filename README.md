# Meetup Event Manager

A React application that helps Meetup event organizers manage their waitlists efficiently by allowing them to move members from waitlist to "going" status in bulk, while respecting Meetup's API rate limits.

## Features

- 🔐 OAuth2 authentication with Meetup
- 📋 View all events you're organizing
- 👥 Manage event waitlists
- ⚡ Bulk update member statuses with progress tracking
- 🚦 Rate limit handling with sequential processing
- 📊 Real-time progress indicators
- 🎯 Error handling and retry mechanisms

## Live Demo

Visit [https://yashrajnayak.github.io/meetup](https://yashrajnayak.github.io/meetup) to see the application in action.

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- A Meetup account with organizer privileges
- Meetup API OAuth credentials

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashrajnayak/meetup.git
cd meetup
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Meetup OAuth credentials:
```env
VITE_MEETUP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Builds the application with the correct base URL
2. Handles environment variables securely
3. Deploys to GitHub Pages

## Rate Limiting

The application implements careful rate limit handling:

- Sequential processing of member status updates
- 1-second delay between requests
- Automatic retry on rate limit errors
- Progress tracking for bulk operations

## CORS and Proxy Configuration

The application uses a multi-proxy setup to handle CORS and API access:

### Cloudflare Worker Proxy

The primary proxy is a Cloudflare Worker that handles:
- GraphQL requests to Meetup's API
- Authentication token forwarding
- CORS headers and preflight requests
- Error handling and response validation

Configuration in `meetup-proxy-worker.js`:
```js
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://yashrajnayak.github.io',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, OPTIONS',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': 'true'
}
```

### Fallback Proxy

A fallback proxy (AllOrigins) is configured for redundancy:
- Automatic failover if primary proxy is unavailable
- Health checks to monitor proxy status
- Transparent request forwarding

### Error Handling

The proxy system includes:
- Detailed error logging
- Invalid JSON response detection
- GraphQL-specific error handling
- Status code propagation
- Automatic retry with fallback proxies
